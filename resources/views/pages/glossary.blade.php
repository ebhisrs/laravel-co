Under such circumstances the Limit Order may not be executed and the limit order will remain in effect, until that time when the order can be executed or until the Customer cancels the order. A Limit Order specifies that execution should be attempted after the market reaches or goes through a set price level - the limit price.

<p>A demand for additional funds to be deposited in a margin account to meet margin requirements because of adverse exchange rate movements.</p>
<h6>MARGIN</h6>
<p>The aggregate amount of customer cash pledged against the aggregate Open Position(s). The margin pledged is a function of the leverage ratio. The higher the leverage, the lower the pledged Margin. The lower the leverage, the higher the Margin needed to carry the position.

Mathematically, Margin = Open Position Amount / Maximum Trading Leverage Ratio. For example, a USD/CHF 100,000 USD position at Maximum Trading Leverage Ratio 50:1 will require pledged Margin equal to 100,000/50 or $2,000.

Note: To calculate margin for currency pairs, where USD is NOT the Base (First) Currency (e.g. EUR/USD, GBP/USD;) and crosses (EUR/JPY, GBP/JPY;), the Counter Currency amount is first converted into USD using the average exchange rate(s).

Example: Customer buys 1 lot of EUR/USD when the price is .9600 9604. The average exchange rate is .9602. Therefore, 100,000 EUR equals 96,020 USD. $96,020 / 50 Leverage Ratio = $1,920.40</p>
